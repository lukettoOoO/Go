// zeroval has an int parameter, so arguments will be passed to it by value
// zeroval will get a copy of ival distinct from the one in the calling function
func zeroval(ival int) {
	ival = 0
}

// zeroptr in constrast has an *int parameter, meaning that it takes an int pointer
// the *iptr code in the function body then dereferences the pointer from its memory address to the current value at that address
// assigning a value to a dereferenced pointer changes the value at the referenced address
func zeroptr(iptr *int) {
	*iptr = 0
}

	fmt.Println("zeroval:", i)

	// the &i syntax gives the memory address of i, i.e. a pointer to i
	zeroptr(&i)
	fmt.Println("zeroptr:", i)

	// pointers can be printed too
	fmt.Println("pointer:", &i)

	// a new pointer to a value can be created with the builtin function new
	p := new(int)
	*p = 42
	fmt.Println("value at *p:", *p)
	zeroptr(p)
	fmt.Println("value at *p:", *p)

	// zeroval doesn't change the i in main, but zeroptr does because it has a reference to the memory address for that variable
